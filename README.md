# EchoPrint

EchoPrint is an open-source Arduino-based hardware and software system to accompany the Creality3D Ender-3 or Ender-3 Pro 3D printers to enable 3D printing for visually disabled creators. 

The EchoPrint GitHub is designed for easy screenreader navigation of the creation and usage of the EchoPrint. It is meant to accompany the Ender-3's SainSmart 3D Printer User Guide and be used with a pre-built and set-up Ender-3 printer.

This system has two components: a screen reader for the built in LCD screen and 2. 3D-Printed printer and safety guards. To reproduce the system, please refer to Quick Start [Step 0] to get started.
